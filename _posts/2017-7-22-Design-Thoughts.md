title: What's in a Name?

It took a while to find a name I could live with.  Naming really is one of the [two hard things](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html).

I like the "Two Selves" concept from Tim Gallwey's [The Inner Game of Tennis](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/905.The_Inner_Game_of_Tennis).  I would apply his philosophy to programming like this:

Turn off your inner self-critic.  Stop worrying if your code is elegant or professional.  Don't write self-consciously for an imagined audience.  Just... write.  Build.  Deploy.  Improvement will come with time.  My goal is to write code every day, to experience [flow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66354.Flow), and to eventually reach that level of mastery where ideas translate to code without conscious thought or effort.
 
 It's worth a shot.
