I'm excited to build a home for personal projects, toys, tutorials, and ideas.  This blog will document my design process and any interesting architectural tradeoffs I encounter while converting my ideas folder into reality.  Step One: Setting up this blog!

To get up and running quickly, I forked the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.  I'll refine the layout over time, but shipping _something_ is my top priority for today.
